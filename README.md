## Why and How I work on this project
#### Recently, I am addicted to WORDLE, and I have seen a lot of people building clones of WORDLE on Youtube.
#### Over the past few months, I have been learning React and working with it. Therefore, why not build a WORDLE clone using React?
#### In this project, I used `React` for UI, `styled-components` for styling ,and `React Context API` for state management.

## What I would like to improve if I had more time
* Fix styles for mobile devices / make styles responsive
* Add Hard Mode and Toggle Theme in the setting
* Change the game from daily new word to new word every game
